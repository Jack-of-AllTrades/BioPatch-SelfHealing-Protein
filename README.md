# 🧬 BioPatch – Open-Source Self-Healing Fusion Protein

**BioPatch** is a synthetic fusion protein designed to enable **self-healing textiles**.  
It combines domains from spider silk, resilin, and mussel foot proteins to mimic nature’s best materials — and make fabrics that heal like skin.

## 💡 Why BioPatch?

🌍 Textile waste is one of the biggest environmental problems of our time.  
👕 Clothing rips, degrades, and is discarded.  
**What if it could heal instead?**

BioPatch is a modular fusion protein:
- 🧱 **MaSp1 (Spider Silk)** – Strength  
- 🌀 **Resilin** – Elastic recoil  
- 🎯 **Mfp-3** – Sticky, surface-adhesive tail  
- 🔗 Linked with **GGGGS** peptides for motion

## 🔬 Project Highlights

- ✅ Full protein folded with **pLDDT 82.26**
- ✅ Simulated with CABS-flex
  - Stable core (MaSp1)
  - Elastic midsection (Resilin)
  - Flexible adhesive tail (Mfp-3)
- ✅ RMSF > 7 Å at healing regions
