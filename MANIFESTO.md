# 🌱 The BioPatch Manifesto

**We believe that biology belongs to everyone.**

We built BioPatch to prove a simple, powerful idea:  
🧬 *That anyone — anywhere — can design life-changing biomaterials with nothing but curiosity, code, and courage.*

## 🧵 What is BioPatch?

BioPatch is a synthetic fusion protein, designed using AI and inspired by nature.  
It combines the strength of spider silk, the elasticity of insect muscle, and the adhesion of mussel glue — to create clothing and materials that can *heal themselves*.

It’s not just a protein. It’s a prototype for a better future.

## 🛡️ Why We’re Open-Sourcing It

This project is prior art.  
It cannot be patented. It is **open forever.**

We release this into the world because:
- The world needs healing materials
- Open science accelerates discovery
- Innovation should be shared
